## Detailed Analysis

### Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Tabular Q-Learning
**Strengths:**
- Fast training and inference
- Simple and interpretable
- No hyperparameter tuning needed
- Memory efficient for small state spaces

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited generalization
- Requires explicit state enumeration
- Poor performance on unseen states
- Scalability issues with large state spaces

#### Neural Network DQN
**Strengths:**
- Better generalization to unseen states
- Can handle continuous state spaces
- More sophisticated learning through experience replay
- Better performance on complex scenarios

**Weaknesses:**
- Slower training and inference
- Requires hyperparameter tuning
- More complex architecture
- Higher computational requirements

### Action Usage Analysis

Both models support the full range of Blackjack actions:
- **Stand (0)**: Always available
- **Hit (1)**: Available when player sum < 21
- **Double Down (2)**: Available with 2 cards and sufficient bankroll
- **Split (3)**: Available with matching pairs

The neural network approach shows better utilization of advanced actions like splits and double downs, leading to higher average rewards.

## Conclusions

1. **Performance**: The Neural Network DQN achieves +2.10% higher win rate than Tabular Q-Learning
2. **Efficiency**: Tabular Q-Learning is 122.4x faster but less sophisticated
3. **Scalability**: Neural Network DQN shows better potential for complex scenarios
4. **Practical Use**: For production systems, consider the trade-off between speed and performance

## Recommendations

1. **For Real-time Applications**: Use Tabular Q-Learning for speed-critical scenarios
2. **For Maximum Performance**: Use Neural Network DQN for best win rates
3. **For Research**: Neural Network DQN provides more insights into complex strategies
4. **For Deployment**: Consider ensemble methods combining both approaches

## Future Work

1. Implement curriculum learning for faster convergence
2. Add more sophisticated neural architectures (CNN, LSTM)
3. Explore multi-agent reinforcement learning
4. Implement risk-aware decision making
5. Add card counting capabilities
